# Kathy Chiang's Portfolio

My name is Kathy Chiang and I am currently a student from Cal State Fullerton [http://fullerton.edu/] majoring in Computer Engineering!

Lab 8
Lab 8 Part 2 was a favorite because it was slightly confusing, but still fun. We had to print out a message that consisted of dashes and slashes, adding and subtracting each of them as you enter a new line. It helped me learn how the loops that include int i work, since I never understood it prior. 

Lab 7
Lab 7 was a favorite because it helped me understand how the .size function worked, as well as the .at function. It was also one of the first labs that included the "!" symbol, both of which helping me develop basics to for future labs. However, if I directly followed the lab instructions, my unit tests wouldn't work despite the code working. I asked a TA about it, and she told me that the directions itself was causing my unit test to fail. 

Lab 11
Lab 11 Part 1 was a favorite because it was my first time seeing the function .push_back. In this lab, we were working with CSV, rows, and columns. It helped me develop a basic understanding of everything, though I cannot say I understand it 100%.
